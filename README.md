## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Option 1: Using Startup Scripts (Recommended)

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

#### On Windows:
```cmd
start-dev.bat
```

This will:
1. Create Python virtual environment (if needed)
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Install Node.js dependencies
4. Start the backend on http://localhost:8000
5. Start the frontend on http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the backend:
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

When domains are selected:
- **A** - Mark as OK
- **S** - Mark for Review
- **D** - Mark as Reject
- **O** - Open/collapse details

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration

Edit `main.py` to configure:
- Database connection
- API endpoints
- Port settings

### Frontend Configuration

Edit `frontend/vite.config.ts` to configure:
- API proxy settings
- Port settings
- Build options

## üìä Database

The application uses SQLite with Alembic for migrations.

### Run Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Create New Migration

```bash
alembic revision -m "description"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

### Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `frontend/dist/`.

### Production Deployment

1. Build the frontend
2. Serve static files from `frontend/dist/`
3. Run the Python backend with a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn)

## üìù Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses hot module replacement (HMR) for instant updates during development.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend Development

The backend will need to be restarted after code changes.

```bash
python main.py
```

## üß™ Testing

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

### Backend Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 or 8000 is already in use:
- Change the frontend port in `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Change the backend port in `main.py`

### Dependencies Not Installing

- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf frontend/node_modules && cd frontend && npm install`

### Database Issues

- Delete `ahrefs_data.db` and run migrations again
- Check database permissions
